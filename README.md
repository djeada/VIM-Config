Check if VIM is already installed:

    which vim

On Debian based systems:

    apt install vim

## Installing plugins with vim-plug

Open the terminal and run the following command:

    curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

Add following text to your ~/.vimrc file:

```vim
